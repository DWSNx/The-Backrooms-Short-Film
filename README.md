# The Backrooms Short Film

A 36-second horror short film exploring the eerie, infinite maze-like world of the Backrooms. The project combines 3D environment design, detailed asset creation, photogrammetry, and post-production to create a visually immersive experience.

## Tools and Workflow
- **Blender:** Modeled, textured, and animated 3D environments, optimizing geometry and scene performance.  
- **ZBrush:** Sculpted high-detail 3D assets, creating complex and organic forms for realistic models.  
- **Photoshop:** Developed 50+ custom textures by blending multiple images per texture to enhance realism.  
- **Polycam & Meshroom:** Captured and processed real-world objects via photogrammetry for integration into 3D scenes.  
- **DaVinci Resolve:** Composited, color graded, and added sound design to complete the final short film.
